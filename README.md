# Untitled Game

Our submission for the [Pirate Software - Game Jam 16](https://itch.io/jam/pirate)  

## Before running the project
Setting up a virtual environment is a good idea (helpful resource below)  
Install the project requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the project on your machine
Simply run the `main.py` file located in `src/`
```
python3 main.py
```
## Assembling the project for web
Install pygbag (not in requirements.txt as it is not needed to run the project)
```
pip install pygbag
```
To run a web build of the project locally run this command inside the `src/` folder
```
pygbag --template custom.tmpl .
```
Then go to http://localhost:8000/ to test the web build  
A web build has been created in a new folder `build/`  
Just compress the `web/` directory inside of `build/` and upload this compressed file to Itch.io
